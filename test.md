Certainly! Let's break down the Python solution for the "Perfect Rectangle" problem step by step.

### Problem Insight:

Recall our two key observations:
1. The combined area of all small rectangles should equal the area of the large rectangle.
2. The corners of the large rectangle should appear only once, while all other points where rectangles meet should appear an even number of times.

### Solution Breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   x1, y1 = float('inf'), float('inf')
   x2, y2 = float('-inf'), float('-inf')
   corners = set()
   area = 0
   ```
   - `x1`, `y1`: Bottom-left corner of the large rectangle.
   - `x2`, `y2`: Top-right corner of the large rectangle.
   - `corners`: A set to store the corners of all rectangles.
   - `area`: To store the total area covered by all small rectangles.

2. **Iterate over each rectangle**:
   ```python
   for rect in rectangles:
   ```
   For each rectangle, the code does the following:

   a. **Updates the potential corners of the large rectangle**:
      ```python
      x1 = min(rect[0], x1)
      y1 = min(rect[1], y1)
      x2 = max(rect[2], x2)
      y2 = max(rect[3], y2)
      ```
      - This updates the minimum values for the bottom-left corner and the maximum values for the top-right corner.

   b. **Updates the total area**:
      ```python
      area += (rect[2] - rect[0]) * (rect[3] - rect[1])
      ```
      - Adds the area of the current rectangle to the total area.

   c. **Handles the corners of the current rectangle**:
      ```python
      for point in [(rect[0], rect[1]), (rect[0], rect[3]), (rect[2], rect[3]), (rect[2], rect[1])]:
          if point in corners:
              corners.remove(point)
          else:
              corners.add(point)
      ```
      - The four corners of the current rectangle are created as tuples.
      - The loop checks each corner: 
          - If the corner is already in the `corners` set, it is removed.
          - If it's not, it's added to the set. 
      - This ensures that corners appearing twice are eliminated from the set.

3. **Final Checks**:

   a. **Check the four corners of the large rectangle**:
      ```python
      if {(x1, y1), (x1, y2), (x2, y1), (x2, y2)} != corners:
          return False
      ```
      - This checks if the set contains only the four corners of the large rectangle. If there are other corners left in the set, or if any of these four corners are missing, it returns `False`.

   b. **Check the area**:
      ```python
      return area == (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1)
      ```
      - Ensures that the combined area of all small rectangles equals the area of the large rectangle.

### Summary:

In this Python solution, we utilize the properties of sets and the efficiency and clarity of tuples to determine if the given rectangles can form a large rectangle without overlaps or gaps. The logic is similar to the Java solution, but the use of tuples makes the code more concise and readable.
